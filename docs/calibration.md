# Calibration

Nothing here is measured on your traffic until you measure it. Turn on `shadow`, run for a while, then `/sift log 200` shows every decision with the probabilities behind it. Adjust `lo`, `hi` and the keep thresholds from what you see, then turn shadow off. The Jev backend is the one worth calibrating: its uncertainty band is real, and the modules treat `unclear` as "do the safe thing" (deliver, keep, deny) on purpose.
